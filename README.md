# LinearRegressionProject02
This project predicts house prices using Linear Regression on a Kaggle dataset. Data is cleaned by encoding categorical values, then split into training and testing sets. The model is evaluated using RÂ² and MAE, visualized with graphs, and a custom function allows price prediction for new inputs.
